# Covid Tracker

## What is it?

Well, Covid Tracker is a web app built using Gatsby/React and Axios.  It shows you the data reported for a respective state.  Stats like:

- number of positive tests
- number of negative tests
- total tests
- patients hospitalized
- patients recovered
- deaths
- increase in positive tests
- increase in negative tests
- increase in total tested
- much more

## What else is it?

Well using the data pulled from [Covid Tracking](https://covidtracking.com/data/api/) I plug the JSON data into a mapping software that allows us to create a map/ chart that shows the information in an easier to read and colorful display.


## Whats next?

Well here is my ToDo List for this app after getting it released:

- Add more Mapping abilities
- Custom Charts
- Vaccination numbers from Data
- Resources for each state on where to get tested
- Resources on where to go to get vaccinated
